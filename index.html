          All human beings are entrepreneurs. When we were in the caves, we were
          all self-employed, finding our food, feeding ourselves. That’s where
          human history began. As civilization came, we suppressed it. We became
          ‘labor’ because they stamped us, ‘You are labor.’ We forgot that we
          are entrepreneurs.Poverty is not created by the poor. It is created by
          the system we have built, the institutions we have designed, and the
          policies we pursue.When you take the first step, you’ll find the

            Italy is exploring a potential agreement with Elon Musk's Starlink
            to provide secure satellite communications for government,
            diplomatic, and defense operations in high-risk areas. Valued at 1.5
            billion euros over five years, the deal would ensure that Italian
            institutions maintain full control over their data while utilizing
            U.S. technology to safeguard national interests. Discussions began
            prior to the current administration, with assurances that data
            sovereignty would be preserved
